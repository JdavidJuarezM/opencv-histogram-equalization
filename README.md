# Opencv-histogram-equalization
Performs histogram equalization on an image to improve contrast.

This script uses OpenCV and Matplotlib to load an image, convert it to
grayscale, and then apply histogram equalization to enhance its contrast.
It saves the grayscale image, the equalized image, and the histograms
for both.

Dependencies:
    - opencv-python
    - matplotlib
    - numpy

Usage:
    1. Save this script in a folder.
    2. Place an input image named 'input_image.jpg' in the same folder.
    3. Run the script. All output files will be saved to a new
       'output/' subfolder.
